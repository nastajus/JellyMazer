## Game Jam

One afternoon, in a sweet fall day, I decided my friends & I would do a game jam. It's been too long. I fed them pizzas.

## Requirements

* generate up to four concurrent maze paths overlapping, removing all walls that interfere with any path.
* four player, controller-based gameplay, web-based, racing through levels from a segregated-yet-nearby start areas, to a single finishing area that holds all players.
* Accelerated gameplay that completes levels in approximately 10 seconds of gameplay, where you rapidly bash into walls, with a resounding thud & squishing animation.
* ability to bash players, but costs you let's say 1 second, and holds them for 2 seconds? to experiment to see what's fun. perhaps grant immunity after? 
* ability to grab & pull items, though uncertain what benefits this confers. perhaps a sword, a shield. but i want there to be a slow-down pentalty for having this powerup tethered following behind you.
* cutesy animations & sound effects. Going for a vibe here that's engaging. To experiment.
